🚀 SpAIceRocks: Intergalactic Match 3 Mining Adventure

Journey across a dystopian galaxy as an interplanetary mining prospector, matching and collecting valuable minerals across six uniquely haunting worlds. Each planet tells its own dark tale - from toxic swamps and polluted underbellies to frozen moons harboring ancient secrets. You just need a mouse to play. 

Key Features:

🌎 Explore 6 Distinct Planets: Each with its own atmosphere, character, and exclusive minerals to mine

📈 Dynamic Board Expansion: Success unlocks larger mining operations - start small and expand up to 12x12 grids

⛏️ Strategic Mining Tools: Unlock and deploy powerful clearing tools:

Plus Clearers: Clear minerals in a cross pattern

Column Clearers: Clear entire vertical sections

Row Clearers: Sweep across horizontal lines

💎 Unique Mineral Types: Each planet offers exclusive new minerals to collect and trade

🎯 Progressive Challenge: Clear boards to earn credits and unlock access to new worlds

🎮 Strategic Gameplay: Balance your moves, tool usage, and mineral matching to maximize profits

🏆 Level-Based Progression: Complete collection goals to advance and expand your mining operation

Start your mining empire on a humble beginning world, then use your earnings to unlock access to new planets, each with their own valuable resources. But beware - every world has its own dark history and environmental challenges to overcome.

Match three or more minerals to collect them, but plan carefully - you have limited moves to meet your collection goals. Use your earned credits wisely: invest in powerful clearing tools, unlock new mineral types, or save up to purchase rights to mine on new planets.
